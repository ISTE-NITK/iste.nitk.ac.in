                        Discussing Ideas and brainstorming <br />
                        Multiple ideas for the plot were discussed during
                        several meetings with Chronicle and Create SIG members.
                        Votes were taken and one final script was selected.

                        Finalizing the idea and writing the script <br />
                        Chronicle team members worked on the finalized idea and
                        produced a script.{" "}

                        Volunteers for the movie casting were auditioned and

                        Shooting the required scenes <br />
                        Create members directed the movie and helped the cast
                        shoot the videos. Due to the limitations such as time
                        difference,quarantine restrictions and other
                        limitations, the cast, apart from acting, also had to
                        shoot the videos. Communication between Create members
                        and the cast was done through video calls and all the
                        directions about the camera settings were given online.{" "}

                        Using the modern softwares (adobe premiere pro and adobe
                        after effects), the footage shot by the cast was edited
                        by Create members and was processed to produce the full
                        movie. <br />
                        The initial draft was run through the project mentors
                        and during reviews,we made some tweaks and changes to
                        better suit the film.{" "}

                After some colour grading and adding a tinge of cinematic effect
                to the video we came up with the final results.
