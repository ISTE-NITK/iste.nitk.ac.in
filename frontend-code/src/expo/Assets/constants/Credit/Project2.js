                    While research and literature exists for developed economies
                    with respect to personal finance education, the data and
                    resources for the Indian outlook are limited.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    By designing surveys, we have attempted to capture accurate
                    data that reflects the Indian consensus across varied
                    demographics. 2 surveys created, for each of the project
                    objectives. A combined 150 responses were recorded. The
                    survey aiming to provide data on the impact of financial
                    education was targeted for adults who are well established
                    in their careers. The 3 sections included were: Candidate
                    Information, Financial Status, Exposure to Financial
                    Education.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The survey to gauge financial literacy was aimed for the
                    college-student demographic. We picked questions and gauged
                    their difficulty level and assigned marks. The questions
                    with lower marks are basic and in the realms of general
                    financial literacy and the ones with higher marks require a
                    deeper knowledge of finance to answer.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    MS Excel was used to analyze the collected data. Pivot
                    tables were used extensively.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    On further analysis, insights into the education system and
                    psychology of citizens when it comes to money-matters are
                    revealed. Prior to concluding, a brief overview of measures
                    implemented in other countries is discussed with the purpose
                    of understanding policies and executions that can be
                    imitated and improved upon, providing adaptation to the
                    Indian ecosystem. Existing literature, conference reports
                    and online resources were used to briefly analyse financial
                    education implementations in: Brazil, Indonesia, China,
                    Philippines.

                <b>Conclusion</b>
                <p>
                    Average indian household expenditure: income ratio leaves
                    barely any room for investment to find financial freedom{" "}
                    <br />
                    It’s necessary to implement educational reform, focusing not
                    just on investments but more on taxation, it’s benefits and
                    more macro-economic aspects (will be highlighted further in
                    later report) <br />
                    We’ve also confirmed a direct correlation between financial
                    status in late 30’s - 40’s and financial literacy as a young
                    adult. <br />
                    Financial literacy is a concept for the top 20% of the
                    taxpayers in India per approximates but the pandemic has
                    clearly skewed the stat. (As of now, India has 46M demat
                    accounts)
