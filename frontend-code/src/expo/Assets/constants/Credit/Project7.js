                    With the exponential rise in companies operating in the
                    gig-economy, and with the advent of technology, companies
                    have realised the potential of running their entire core
                    business availing the services of employees on a freelance
                    basis. This project would aim at taking in consideration the
                    sentiments of workers and analysing their functioning in a
                    gig economy. With the job market within the Gig Economy
                    being highly unregulated, the project would also attempt at
                    analysing the regulations already in place, and further
                    regulations that can be implemented.

                    To start with, project members dwelled into the topic of
                    Gig-Economy, concentrating primarily on understanding the
                    Gig Economy; factors leading to its rise in demand; concern
                    behind it (governing laws/regulations); how it benefits the
                    company and the consumer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was followed by the collection of data, looking for
                    companies that operate within the Gig Economy (majority of
                    the workforce primarily employed within the Gig Economy),
                    collecting their market share ratios / market prices, to be
                    used for the extended scope of the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following this, members indulged in a qualitative study
                    (comparative case study) of companies, chosen keeping in
                    mind the clientele they serve and their market
                    capitalization. The study was carried out for Uber {"&"}{" "}
                    Lyft, and Swiggy {"&"} Zomato.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The members then indulged in designing a survey targeted at
                    collecting data from employees of three demographics (those
                    that work/have worked in the gig economy; those that have
                    work experience, but not in the gig economy; students/no
                    work experience). The survey was based on 9 main criteria,
                    divided into perceived advantages (for the workers),
                    perceived disadvantages (for the workers), and variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suitable analysis (Chi-Square Testing and Fishers Exact
                    Test) were then performed on the following - 1. Perceived
                    Advantages and Variables; 2. Perceived Diadvantages and
                    Variables; 3. Need for Regulations and Perceived Advantages
                    and Disadvantages.{" "}

                    With the results found, the need for regulations was
                    analysed, and changes were proposed, along with analysing
                    the effect of COVID on the Gig Economy.{" "}

                <p>
                    The unending quest to cut costs and increase profit has led
                    to a number of challenges in the gig economy, primarily for
                    the workers. The most major shortcoming in the gig economy
                    is the lack of any sort of regulation that protects workers.
                    Since these workers are not classified as employees, they
                    miss out on a number of security benefits such as insurance,
                    pension, healthcare, etc. Moreover, there are no rules
                    governing the number of working hours which becomes
                    concerning when looking at delivery riders and cab drivers.
                    There are no laws on pay apart from the general minimum wage
                    laws. Thus, proper defining regulation is extremely
                    important to secure the rights of the increasing workforce
                    in the gig economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The contracts signed between the company and the contractors
                    gives complete authority for the company to suspend the
                    contractor based on various clauses decided by the company.
                    There are some clauses that give the power to the company to
                    dismiss the contract if the contractor tries to go against
                    the company. The contractors do not get the liberty to raise
                    the issues. For example, the revenue sharing system between
                    Zomato and its delivery personnel is decided by the company
                    and the workers get no say in it whatsoever. This complete
                    lack of negotiating capacity for the individual worker can
                    lead to abuse of power by the organization as was seen in
                    India in recent months when several delivery personnel
                    decided to strike to protest against the new payment
                    structure of Zomato and Swiggy (a food and grocery delivery
                    service app). These companies also suspended inactive
                    accounts during the strike in India and there was no
                    recourse possible. Cab drivers of Uber, Ola and Lyft will
                    have to agree to share in revenue whatever the high
                    authorities of the company decide. This is a great example
                    which indicates that employee do not get the chance to get
                    the basic pay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collectivization in the gig economy is near-impossible for
                    the workers which makes the lack of negotiating power even
                    worse. With no interaction among workers, except in limited
                    geographical areas, coming together under one umbrella for
                    their own good is very difficult. There has been some
                    progress and it is expected that the rise of the gig economy
                    will give rise to more workers’ unions.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another problem that arises from a lack of regulation is
                    that of non-payment of or lower payment than the agreed upon
                    sum. This problem of wage theft is widespread in the
                    freelance industry and the only recourse available is to go
                    to court which is not feasible most of the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the key recommendations from a new report recently
                    issued by the World Bank, in conjunction with the
                    International Labour Organization (ILO), is that countries
                    need to extend their social and labour protections to people
                    who are working part time or in serial part time or
                    temporary jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key to making this happen could be to use the very same
                    technology that is being used to drive the gig economy.
                    There is huge scope for governments to use technology for
                    enforcing the new regulations. Most transactions on the gig
                    economy are done via the internet and as such they can be
                    tracked. Hence, these companies do need to contribute to
                    insurance and other social contributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the gig economy is not really a new way of working.
                    Rather, many people who are working this way are employees
                    in disguise. As such the employers are not paying the true
                    costs for employing them. The gig economy is a way of
                    externalizing costs. In other words, it allows some sectors
                    of society not to pay the true costs for making profits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if the reforms are brought in the gig economy, there
                    are certain disadvantages too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The business model of companies like Uber and Lyft or Swiggy
                    and Zomato is to operate and provide services to the
                    customers at a lowest possible price. That is the biggest
                    margin from which these companies make profit. If these
                    companies are asked to make the certain benefits mandatory,
                    then the rates they charge for the customer will also
                    increase from what it is now.

                    There is substantial need and scope for implementing reform
                    in the gig-economy. There are several ways through which
                    this can be achieved.

                        Confirming and enforcing existing labour laws to extend

                        many countries have a lot of shortcomings, this
                        extension will likely only be possible after litigation

                    Covid-19 has had both positive as well as negative impacts
                    on the Gig Economy. When the lockdown was implemented all
                    over the world, businesses were forced to shut down and so
                    companies started laying off the workers to reduce the
                    expenses. People started to look out for temporary jobs and
                    a sudden surge was seen in the freelancing workforce all
                    over the world. People who were already working in the Gig
                    economy were also affected depending on the industry and
                    location. It looks like they were benefited upto some extent
                    because companies started hiring people for temporary
                    purposes. With the increase in the number of job seekers in
                    the Gig workspace because of worldwide layoffs and salary
                    reduction, competition was at peak and the price paid for
                    gigs was decreased compared to the pre-covid times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the pre-covid times gig workers in India used to earn an
                    average of 25000 Rs. per month. Later on when the lockdown
                    was imposed the average income of gig workers slipped down
                    below 15000 Rs. per month. According to a survey conducted
                    by Flourish, ride-sharing drivers were affected the most
                    with 90%of them reporting income loss. House cleaners were
                    the next on the list with 72% of them reporting income loss.
                    Uber saw a major drop of 53% year on year basis in the
                    number of trips bookings.It also laid off 600 employees in
                    India and a total of 6700 employees globally during the
                    pandemic. Food delivery startup of Uber that is Uber Eats
                    doubled year on year basis as people preferred ordering food
                    rather than going out. Zomato in their Mid COVID-19
                    Performance Report said that the pandemic has positively
                    impacted the health of the business and they were expecting
                    to get the business back on track by the end of third
                    quarter of FY20.

                <p>
                    In the case of LYFT the revenue of the third quarter was
                    almost half on QoQ basis but rose by 47% compared to the
                    second quarter of FY20. It also laid off 17% of it’s
                    workforce and the net loss of the 3rd quarter was almost the
                    same as that of last year.

                    Recent policy progresses in response to the Covid-19 crisis
                    have shown a growing number of platforms offering preventive
                    measures, as well as increased support in the case of
                    illness for many gig workers. Most of the platforms that
                    have introduced policies in support of workers have been
                    adamant that these are extraordinary measures developed in
                    response to the Covid-19 crisis and promising that similar
                    policies are introduced in the near future . The downside of
                    the policies is that most of them come with an expiry date
                    and only cover the basics . Only minority of platforms have
                    rolled out more encompassing forms of protection, such as
                    the establishment of sickness funds, the provision of health
                    insurance or the reduction of rental costs, with even fewer
                    introducing forms of protection like the right to unlimited
                    time off without penalty.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Gig workers in the pre-pandemic era were mostly doing it as
                    a part time job for extra income while some used it as a
                    method to provide opportunities when in between employment.
                    However, the pandemic has made it clear that these people
                    aren’t the only group as most gig workers have started to
                    depend on gig work for income. India is among the top 3
                    in-demand countries for online work behind the US and UK
                    globally. The gig economy is expected to grow further in the
                    post-pandemic era. Gig workers enjoy greater independence
                    and flexibility than the traditional salaried person while
                    it allows companies to assume much of the power of employers
                    with none of the responsibility. Thus, it’s a big advantage
                    for both groups. The pandemic could well prove to be
                    essential in the usage of gig workers for knowledge work,
                    and many companies will benefit from the direct or indirect
                    cost savings that the gig economy will offer.
