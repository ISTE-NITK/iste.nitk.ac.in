                The study on the formation of candlestick patterns was done to
                find out the different candlestick patterns and identify their
                accuracy. The study was done to spot if these patterns help the
                investors to check whether the candlestick patterns are
                dependable for trading decisions. This study was conducted based
                on the past years of the Nifty index.

                    Nine firms were selected from various industries to
                    diversify the portfolio. This was done to get a broader
                    picture of the market and to minimise the fundamental
                    factors. To further cut back on the fundamental factors, a
                    few dates were ignored when the selected companies were
                    either in the news and a few days where the firms’ reports
                    were announced.

                    A few simple technical indicators namely Relative Strength
                    Index (RSI), Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Moving Average
                    Convergence Divergence (MACD) were selected to check the
                    accuracy of these indicators to support our selected
                    candlestick patterns. The accuracy of these indicators to
                    support the patterns were determined based on the following:
                    if RSI is above 70, it is considered to be overbought and if
                    the RSI is below 30, it is considered to be oversold. A
                    candlestick pattern will support RSI at the point of
                    overbought or oversold. SMA supporting a candlestick pattern
                    was checked by observing if SMA was passing through the
                    selected pattern. When the MACD crosses the signal line, a
                    trade signal is issued. The crossovers of MACD and signal
                    line shows overbought or oversold signals.

                    The frequency of candlestick patterns and their accuracy
                    were primarily obtained from our codes. The risk of the
                    candlestick patterns and their rate of return were
                    calculated. The accuracy of the technical indicators in
                    supporting each pattern was calculated as well.

                    understanding of the candlestick patterns and the indicators
                    in supporting these patterns. The inconsistency of the
                    patterns was expected as believed since a few of the
                    patterns occurred over 2,500 times while few never occurred
                    in any of the 9 stocks over the time period. Here is the

                    The risk and return of the patterns were calculated using a
                    code, here the order was placed to buy when a pattern
                    occurred and on hitting 50 pips, the order was closing with
                    a profit. And the stop loss was placed at 20 pips. The risk
                    and return was calculated for only six patterns as the other
                    three patterns did not occur many times and the risk and
                    return wouldn't be much. The risk was calculated by using
                    standard deviation of the returns of each company and the
                    patterns.

                    A lot of it has to do with the relative accessibility of the

                    As frequency of occurrence and popularity of a pattern

                    may trade according to the pattern’s expected or theoretical
                    occurrence. This behavior is what sometimes causes the
                    pattern to go the other way.{" "}

                    It is evident that the salient candlestick patterns have no
                    predictive power. Therefore, investors should mainly focus
