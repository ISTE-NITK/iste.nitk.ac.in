                    The study found that there are a few concepts that have
                    commercial potential. Application of satellite imagery in
                    agriculture is already gaining traction in developed
                    countries and it has potential in India as well. The study
                    highlights the pathway through which satellite imagery can
                    be procured by farmers in India, which will help in better
                    farm monitoring and increase in crop yields. The study also
                    identified the looming threat of the space junk problem and
                    how, through changes in regulation and better enforcement,
                    there are opportunities for companies to undertake
                    profitable ventures whilst tackling the space junk problem
                    head on, thereby making a business case for undertaking
                    mitigation measures and making a safer environment for all
                    infrastructure and human spaceflight operations in orbit.

                    The study enabled the team to come to the conclusion that
                    there is a wide range of applications of space based
                    technology and that space offers a completely new dimension
                    for development and commercialization of new technologies.
                    During research, the team came across a myriad of potential
                    new avenues for expansion of industry into space and it is
                    safe to say that space has the potential to be the next
                    business frontier. Some in the industry liken space
                    industrialization to the Internet. Initially, the Internet
                    was only seen as an information portal but today it is the
                    foundation of the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of
                    people. There is a huge scope for expansion of industry into
                    space, particularly for software development, manufacturing
                    and tourism and all it needs is a little kickstart which can
                    be enabled by better regulations and proactive government
                    policies.
