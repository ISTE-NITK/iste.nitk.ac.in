                            From the regression we can see that, with increasing
                            subsidy the number of power looms in the country
                            also increased in a noticeable trend.

                            Power looms demand with subsidy doesnâ€™t seem to
                            follow a specific trend with the amount of subsidy.
                            Therefore, power looms demand depends very less on
                            Subsidy.
