              <p>
                Since 2017, at Social Initiatives ISTE NITK, our motive has been
                to nurture a socially inclusive environment in which students of
                NITK develop a healthy open-minded attitude and awareness
                towards various social issues, like inequality,
                indiscrimination, mental health issues etc., and thereby
                inculcate a cooperative and caring nature towards everyone else.
              </p>
              <p>
                To bring about these, we regularly organize events and workshops
                related to social awareness in NITK and have received a positive
                response from the students. Some of the activities are open mic
                events, group discussions on social topics and interviews with
                people to share their views and opinions on a particular topic.
                We aim to continue organizing such events and make a positive
                contribution to society.

                    ISTE NITK social initiatives had a visit to the KREC English Medium School on campus. This was a program to create a career workshop by teaching basic science to the students there. Packed with laughter, playful games, and wide beaming smiles, the few hours spent here left our members with a renewed zeal to give back to the world.

                  <li>ISTE NITK hosted a collection drive for St. Joseph’s Prashanth Nivas, a home for the elderly, differently-abled and school-going children. Students from NITK contributed clothes, books, and stationery to be given to the more needy, following our motto of giving back to the society.

                    Following up the collection drive earlier that year, a few of our members visited and donated our collection to St. Joseph’s Prashanth Nivas, a home for the elderly, differently abled and school-going children, on the 3rd of November 2019. The entire experience was truly a heartwarming one. Our members were pleasantly surprised at how excited the residents of St. Joseph’s Prashanth Nivas were to receive visitors.

                    Did you know that at least 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans each year?. More microplastic in our oceans than the stars in the Milky Way! ISTE NITK social initiatives came with a solution and made a Zero Waste Kit which one should keep with them. This planet needs your help, start now by using the zero waste kit.

                  <li>“Speak up! Be brave!” While we tend to expect this out of survivors of sexual abuse, how often do we really listen? Even after the trauma, one experiences rampant flashbacks and this Post Traumatic Stress might take even a couple of years to heal. Our beloved member of ISTE has taken us on their journey of healing through trauma.

                  <li>ISTE NITK's Social Initiatives hosted an event called 'About Bloody Time' to shed light on menstrual health and break the taboo surrounding it. Gynaecologist Dr. Trupta Naik joined the conversation to offer an empathetic understanding of the topic. UNICEF reports that 87% of women are unaware of menstrual health practices and 14% of men lack knowledge on menstrual health. Attendees shared their thoughts and personal stories on period stigma, working towards creating a more informed society.

                    The Rotaract Club of NITK and ISTE NITK hosted an open mic event called 'It's okay not to be okay' to raise awareness on mental health issues and combat the stigma surrounding them. Along with this event, the club also encouraged students to send in creative pieces of work in line with the theme of mental health and its importance. Attendees submitted artworks, poems, stories, and more, with the option to remain anonymous. This event aimed to bring people together to support one another and create positive change.

                    ISTE NITK celebrated Pride Month by creating a safe space for members of the LGBTQ+ community to come together and learn through fun events and discussions. Our club also shared a powerful blog piece called '1965', which tells the story of a gay man fighting for gay rights in the 1960s USA and finding strength in doing what is right. If you missed it, be sure to check out the link in the bio for more information on our efforts to support and ally with the LGBTQ+ community.

                    ISTE NITK hosted an event called 'Guess Who?' to raise awareness about LGBTQ+ struggles, accomplishments, and icons. In conjunction with this event, we also released a blog called 'Pages From a Father's Diary' that explores the thoughts and emotions of a father as he comes to terms with the fact that his son is gay. The blog delves into the heart of the matter and asks, 'What is greater? The laws of the land or the heart?' It's a poignant reminder of the importance of acceptance and understanding in today's world.
