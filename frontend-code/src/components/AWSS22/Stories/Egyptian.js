<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>A long time back, Egypt was a land full of bliss and joy under the rule of the Sekhemkhet dynasty. Being blessed by the Sun God Ra for their faithfulness and loyalty, the land prospered as it had never before. It was the Golden Era of the Old Kingdom.</p>

<p>Trade with other civilizations flourished, be it the Mycenaean civilization in Greece or the Indus Valley Civilization in India. The lands near the river Nile were so fertile, literally, anything could be grown on them. The people lived in peace and prosperity, and even the poorest of them lived a lifestyle that is envious by today&rsquo;s standards.</p>

<p>However, darkness was looming on the land. Around 1500 BC, the current ruler of the Old Kingdom, Sekhemkhet IV, was assassinated in a coup by the leader of a strong irreligious sect, whose name was Ashour. They were opposed to the religious principles followed by the kingdom and wanted to establish their own kingdom with their own rules.</p>

<p>Ashour took the name of Amenhotep, meaning that &ldquo;Amon is content&rdquo;. Under the reign of the Amenhotep dynasty, Egypt suffered. They disregarded all religious practices, not even respecting the dead. Angered by this, the God of the afterlife, Anubis, cursed the land. No longer were the lands fertile. What grew the worst crops with ease before, now struggled to grow even the best crops. Without crops, there was not much scope of trade. Trade with other civilizations dwindled.</p>

<p>Now they traded mostly in things like rare stones, oil, or what little could be found in their caves. All this of course meant that the common people, who used to be mostly agricultural, struggled to make ends meet now. They now had to work as slaves for the royalty, or workers in building the large monuments. It was the Dark Age of Egypt under the Amenhoteps.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>

<p>Aisha was the typical example of the everyday Egyptian. Her father Kamal was her only family. They lived in Thebes, which was around 800 kilometres away from the Mediterranean near the banks of the Nile. Kamal worked as a labourer in building the Ramesseum Necropolis near Thebes. In other words, they were part of the lower classes of Egyptian society.</p>

<p>They were the future descendants of the Sekhemkhet dynasty, however, there was no recognition for them from the people, nor was the current pharaoh Amenhotep V looking out for them for persecution. Five generations were quite enough to make everyone, including themselves, forget about their past glory and the subsequent coup in which they lost the throne. In fact, since Egyptian society was quite patriarchal, that made things even more difficult for Aisha. There was no exception for the queen pharaoh that never was.</p>

<p>Even though the royal family themselves was irreligious, the common people couldn&rsquo;t be shaken out of their beliefs. They worshipped the Sun God Ra most faithfully. According to them, His passage across the sky represented the eternal cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.</p>

<p>Aisha was no exception. To her, Ra was the original Egyptian god, as all other Egyptian gods were merged into Him and made Him all the more powerful. He was the king of all deities. She also worshipped Amun, who was the God of the air. His fusion with Ra was &ldquo;Amun-Ra&rdquo; and it represented the raw, universal power of the sun, something which always awed Aisha. No matter how bleak things looked, she was comforted by the fact that He was always looking over her.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>

<p>One day, Aisha was spending the evening strolling across the road. Her father had gone to work for the construction of the Necropolis. Of late, he had been sort of jumpy, as if nervous about something. He tried to stay away from her, though normally he was a very loving father to her. Upon entering alleys, he would look in all directions, as if he were expecting someone to follow him.</p>

<p>Aisha had asked him a few times about why he did that, but he would just reply &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, just being a little careful does not hurt&rdquo;. Aisha&rsquo;s face clearly showed that she believed none of that, but she did not further argue with her father. She suspected that his excursions had some relation to the Pharaoh, as the throne was rightfully theirs. She herself didn&rsquo;t like the Pharaoh, as the people of Egypt were suffering under him.</p>

<p>As she was going around with these thoughts in her mind, she heard a shout ahead of her. &ldquo;Come to the Town Square everyone, the Pharaoh orders everyone.&rdquo; Such was the fear of disobeying the pharaoh that people rushed forward, causing a stampede almost. If they didn&rsquo;t go soon, the agents of Amenhotep would beat them and bring them out of their house, or worse, kill them for disobeying the pharaoh.</p>

<p>So Aisha also hurried up and reached the Square soon enough. A chill ran down her spine. The royal agents were standing in a circle, around a man. Looking closer, she recognized him as her father. His face was pale and bruised. Apparently, they had beaten him soundly before bringing him here. She cried out &ldquo;Ab!&rdquo;, but all he did was look at her. He could say nothing. His eyes read fear and death.</p>

<p>One of the agents held out a scroll and read, &ldquo;This man was found snooping in the pharaoh&rsquo;s palace. He had bribed one of the servants of the pharaoh to take his role. The pharaoh himself caught his subterfuge. No one can fool the all-pervading eyes of the pharaoh. For this blasphemous act, he is hereby condemned to a fate worse than death. He shall be killed, but not only that, we will ensure that his afterlife is as miserable as life here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, one of the agents slashed his leg, two slashed his arms and the leader beheaded him. The agent read out nonchalantly as if nothing had happened. &ldquo;You see what happens to those who blaspheme against the pharaoh. So never dare to go against Him. That is all, you all are dismissed.&rdquo; With that, the agents shooed the people away and then walked away, leaving her father&rsquo;s body, or what was left of it, unattended.</p>

<p>Aisha ran towards it, tears rolling down her cheeks. Her father Kamal had been killed by the agents hired by Amenhotep. They had not just killed him, they had hacked him to pieces mercilessly and desecrated his body. It was a fate worse than just death, for when the body is destroyed, the soul is not allowed to continue its journey to the Field of Reeds. Instead, it becomes a wandering soul, forever stuck here and unable to rest in peace.</p>

<p>As she stood there, her sadness turned to anger. Anger against the pharaoh and his agents, for what they had done. Dislike for the pharaoh flared to hatred and animosity. Her father had been onto something, and had been discovered by the pharaoh. She vowed then and there, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not let you down Ab, I&rsquo;ll finish up what you started. I&rsquo;ll make sure that these men pay for what they&rsquo;ve done to you!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>

<p>Aisha contemplated what to do next. She knew that her father was onto something before he was killed. She had to find out what that was. The best way to do that was to ask people around who served in the palace. So she set about doing just that.</p>

<p>It was not an easy task. Some ignored her questions, others cast disapproving glances at her. Some even openly said to her that proper Egyptian women are not inquisitive. But she endured all their stinging criticisms and respectfully kept asking for information.</p>

<p>One day, she was sitting down dejectedly, weary from the fruitless efforts of the last few days. A girl was approaching her, whom Aisha didn&rsquo;t recognize. Nevertheless, they greeted each other with a slight nod as was customary in the times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Amina&rdquo;, the girl said. &ldquo;Our family works directly for the royal family. I heard you were looking for someone who worked in the palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Aisha perked up. Her efforts had paid off after all. Even though no one told her anything, they did gossip around themselves. This could be a good chance to gather information about the strengths and weaknesses of Amenhotep. So she said, concealing her sudden interest lest it seemed suspicious, &ldquo;That is great indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Magic runs in their family line. The pharaoh is a skilled wizard. I once saw him push away some of his subjects in annoyance. He just raised his hand and the people got blown away, as though his mere push was like a tornado wind to them&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That seems like a terrible power to have&rdquo;, Aisha said, a little surprised to hear this. So the stories about his magic are true, she thought. That made things a little complicated, as she didn&rsquo;t have any superpowers as such.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you get an ability like that?&rdquo; she asked Amina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The God Heka is the source of all things magical. Generations ago, someone in their family must have got these powers from Heka. Now they don&rsquo;t worship anyone, but the power still remains. The power must be stored in some ring or amulet that has been passed down for generations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aisha didn&rsquo;t reply. She was deep in thought, not quite untroubled by what she heard. She thought about asking Amina if she knew where Amenhotep kept the ring when (if?) he took them off.</p>

<p>However before she could ask the question, she heard a shout, &ldquo;There she is, the runt!&rdquo;. A group of soldiers from the palace were running along their way, and they looked very angry and menacing.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>

<p>Aisha ran away from the place, quite sure that her father&rsquo;s killers had decided to get rid of her too. Making sure that no one was still behind her, she hid into the nearby bushes, hoping that no one had seen her.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed, but no one came. Aisha felt increasingly relieved as time passed, but then a terrible thought came to her: what if it was not her, but Amina whom they were after? After all, her family worked at the palace, and the Pharaoh was not the most benevolent of masters.</p>

<p>She went back near Amina&rsquo;s house. Amina and the soldiers were nowhere to be found. Worried, she contemplated where to find them. Since they were the royal guards, it would make sense for them to go towards the palace. Decided, she began to dash towards the palace.</p>

<p>However, while going, she passed by the Town Square. A large gathering of people was there, and a royal guard was reading out from a scroll. &ldquo;Executions!&rdquo;, she exclaimed to herself, memories of the day of her father&rsquo;s death coming back to her. As she looked closely, she saw that Amina, her father and her mother were circled by guards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...having committed an act of great treason, Asim and his entire family shall be executed in retribution for his abominable act.&rdquo; Then, without the slightest hesitation, they first beheaded Amina&rsquo;s mother. Cries came from the crowd, but the royal guards quieted them down with threats. Next was her father Asim. Now they turned towards Amina herself, who was sobbing and fearful.</p>

<p>Aisha was burning from the inside on seeing all of it. &ldquo;Merciless monsters, all of them. Why does Amenhotep do this?&rdquo; Seeing that they were going for Amina next, she couldn&rsquo;t control herself. &ldquo;STOP ITT!&rdquo;, she cried out loud and ran towards them. She knew she couldn&rsquo;t stop them, but better to die in bravery than live in fear. The guards swung in surprise. They were not expecting a confrontation.</p>

<p>Surprised they might be, but unprepared they were not. It was not long before Aisha was tied to a pole. Her hands and feet were tied, rendering her incapable of doing much except twist and turn trying to free herself. Amina looked at her with frightened eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we had a small&#8230; disturbance. But we&rsquo;ve taken care of that. Before the execution proceeds in its normal course, we would like to set an example out of this foolish woman about what happens to those who try to defy the Pharaoh.&rdquo; The guards took out their machetes. &rdquo;We&rsquo;ll not just kill you, that would be too merciful, we&rsquo;ll hack you into so many pieces that people will not believe that you existed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aisha felt terrified despite putting on a defiant face. She prayed to Lord Ra, sure that her life was now in His hands. The royal guards were advancing menacingly towards her, holding their machetes in position. One of them, aiming for her head, started to swing it. Just then, everything froze. It was as if time had stopped for everyone except Aisha. A light appeared in front of her. She could see a faint silhouette emerging from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noble woman, I am Heka, the God of all things magical. I will help you, my child.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>

<p>Aisha stood dumbfounded. She was not certain if she was hallucinating, But the guards stood frozen in their motions. Certainly she could not hallucinate that. At least not if she was alive, that is. But for the time being, being alive and hallucinating was a much better option than being dead.</p>

<p>Moreover, she couldn&rsquo;t have imagined what was in front of her in her craziest dreams. &ldquo;Lord Ra is pleased by your devotion. He sent me to help protect you. I&rsquo;ve got a gift which will help you in your noble quest.&rdquo; Saying that, he gave her a pendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will this protect me, O Great Lord?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see for yourself, my child. When I withdraw my magic, time will start flowing again. However, your powers, enhanced by the purity of your heart, will surprise all. Bring peace to the people of Egypt. Farewell&rdquo;. Saying this, the silhouette vanished.</p>

<p>Time started flowing again, but the guard&rsquo;s machete hacked at the wooden pole. Its intended target was just beside the guard. She punched him, magic lending her hand the strength of steel. Her punch completely tore through his gut, and he dropped soundlessly to the ground.</p>

<p>The others who were advancing were expectedly surprised at this development. They approached her warily, not letting their guard down. However, she used her magic to get incredible speed and dashed forward. She punched one man to the ground, took his machete, and sped towards the others in the blink of an eye. In an instant, all of them fell, beheaded. The lone remaining guard ran away from the scene. Aisha let him go.</p>

<p>The people gathered there stood dumbfounded, then fell to their knees. &ldquo;The Saviour has arrived!&rdquo;, they said with tears in their eyes. &ldquo;The time of oppression has ended.&rdquo; &ldquo;Egypt will see the light of the day.&rdquo; It was not long before a chant of &ldquo;All hail the Saviour! All hail the Merciful Lord Ra!&rdquo; was going on with fervour.</p>

<p>Aisha, extremely uncomfortable by the sudden attention, went to Amina. Apart from a few bruises, she was quite fine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for your parents. I wish &ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amina cut her off, saying &ldquo;You must defeat Amenhotep! What he&rsquo;s done to my family&#8230;&rdquo; She was sobbing, but then rubbed her eyes which reflected sorrow but also determination. &ldquo;Promise me. You&rsquo;ll kill that monster.&rdquo; <br />
And Aisha said, &ldquo;By the Lord Ra, I shall defeat him. For you. For all the people of Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>

<p>She had been unable to save Amina&rsquo;s family. Memories of her own father&rsquo;s execution came to haunt her back. It had been the same back then. Sure, she had intervened later and even got help from Heka, but it took two executions to force her into action.</p>

<p>Just then, she heard a familiar voice saying &ldquo;Aisha, don&rsquo;t be a fool like that, I didn&rsquo;t teach you so much to get scared by a few setbacks&rdquo;. She turned around in wonder, saying &ldquo;Ab, is that you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the Lord Osiris, who else do you think it could be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, in front of her, her father was standing, or at least a translucent figure which looked like her father. She stood dumbfounded there for a moment, wondering if it was real or if her anxiety was causing her to hallucinate. Finally, she decided that it was real, though if her mind used logic or emotion to decide that, she didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ab, it is really you!&rdquo; she cried out in joy, as she went to hug her dear father. However, her hands just passed through her father, and she almost fell down. Her father&rsquo;s body was like thin air, it couldn&rsquo;t be touched. He laughed aloud, &ldquo;Oh Aisha, my body was destroyed back then by the assassins of the devil Amenhotep. No, this isn&rsquo;t my body which you see, this is just my soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since my body got destroyed, Lord Anubis didn&rsquo;t allow me to continue my journey to the Field of Reeds. Instead, I had to stay back here as a wandering soul only.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, Ab&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot do much to help you, I&rsquo;m afraid, other than moral upliftment. But if there&rsquo;s one thing I can tell, it&rsquo;s that you have the Gods on your side. They praise your good heart and soul, and are certain that you&rsquo;ll bring the just rule of Ra back to Egypt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aisha felt elated at this. More than anything, she was glad that her Ab was back, albeit not in a complete form. She felt even more determined to put an end to the evil that was rampant in Amenhotep&rsquo;s rule and free the people of Egypt from tyranny.</p>

<p>And to put an end to it once and for all, she knew what she had to do: go to the palace and confront Amenhotep.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>

<p>
Aisha thought about what to do. The guards would certainly stop her from entering the palace, and a direct confrontation would be bad for her. The Pharaoh had over a thousand palace soldiers. Even with her magic, Aisha was not sure if she could take so many head-ons.</p>

<p>Kamal suddenly spoke, &ldquo;Of course! Why hadn&rsquo;t I thought of this before! This soul of mine, I can make it invisible also. Aisha, I have a plan. We&rsquo;ll go just outside the palace gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you plan to do? You know that we can&rsquo;t take them head-on&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see. I have a plan. Snooping around the palace has its benefits&rdquo;, said Kamal, with a mischievous grin on his face.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>

<p>They stood outside the palace gates, just out of the eyeshot of the two guards guarding it. Kamal had turned himself invisible, and only his sound indicated where he was. He told Aisha, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll move those two out of the way. Then you go in&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The guards nearly jumped out when, apparently out of thin air came a voice, &ldquo;Go into the Hidden Sanctum in the Palace Underground. Your Pharaoh needs you.&rdquo; They looked about uncertainly, not sure if what they heard was their imagination or not. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go, then you shall face the wrath of your Pharaoh! The curse will go down for generations!&rdquo;, he said in a booming, forceful voice. The guards, scared by these sudden proclamations occurring from above, scampered away, lest the angry God strike them down at the very place.</p>

<p>Kamal looked around, then went back to Aisha. &ldquo;The path is clear. Unfortunately, you must continue your quest without me from here. Amenhotep&rsquo;s magic is too strong, he can easily find me out and trap me. I would hinder more than help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Ab, it is okay. Your daughter will make the whole of Egypt free again.&rdquo; And with that, Aisha set forth towards the palace, her magic amulet held in her hand. She was expecting guards at every corner.</p>

<p>With this, Aisha went forward cautiously into the palace. She snooped about carefully, expecting guards at every turn. Surprisingly, her path was empty. No one cried out or stopped her. Not entirely untroubled by this fact, she entered a large hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Lord Ra, this is HUGE!&rdquo;, she exclaimed softly, overcome with the sheer magnitude of what lay in front of her. The walls were lined with paintings. A faint glow came off from them. They were intricately designed, with Lord Horus featured prominently on many of them. In the centre of the hall was an exquisite pillar with hieroglyphics on them.</p>

<p>So engrossed she was in it that she didn&rsquo;t notice someone coming in softly. She nearly jumped on hearing the door get slammed shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, welcome! I was expecting you, I hope the guards gave you no trouble.&rdquo; The voice of Amenhotep boomed in the hall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about you a lot, especially your performance at the Town Square, and that you gave a lot of trouble to my assistants. I just wanted to see for myself who this person is, and I must say I&rsquo;m disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I doubt that anyone of us needs introductions, so let&rsquo;s get down to business. There&rsquo;s a reason for bringing you here. There&rsquo;s only a single entrance to this room, which I just closed. And the key, of course, is with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if I snatch it from you?&rdquo;, snapped Aisha. &ldquo;Oh well, I&rsquo;d love to see you try&rdquo;, said Amenhotep, with a malicious and disturbing smile.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>

<p>Amenhotep and Aisha engaged in battle. Amenhotep had his Pharaoh Sword with him, and he swung it at Aisha, who deftly tried to dodge it. By his magic he disappeared and reappeared at places, so Aisha had to keep her eyes and ears extremely focused. One small misstep could result in her getting sliced by his sword.</p>

<p>She looked for a ring or amulet on him, but it was nowhere to be seen. Either he wore it somewhere else, or he stored the power in something else.</p>

<p>Aisha had a few tricks up her sleeve. She used her magic to give herself an almost inhumanly fast speed and reflexes. She was easily able to dodge the sword attacks of Amenhotep and deliver a few punches of her own in between. As she gave a blow to the stomach, she used her magic to give her hand the strength of steel.</p>

<p>Amenhotep cursed as he struggled from the blow. He looked like he was going to fall over, but then he used his magic yet again to get fully recovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You thought a single punch like that can even do something significant? That&rsquo;s pathetic&rdquo;, he mocked with an evil smile on his face. Then, he pushed his sword towards Aisha at a terrible speed. Aisha dodged it quickly, but then Amenhotep pulled at his sword instead, so it came back at the same speed towards Aisha from behind. She barely saw it coming at the last moment and deftly pushed herself out of the way.</p>

<p>Amenhotep kept pushing and pulling his sword at Aisha like a boomerang, who kept dodging it as she went around the place. This can&rsquo;t go on forever, she thought. The sword was coming at her. She pushed at it instead of dodging. The sword hung in mid-air between Amenhotep and Aisha, being pushed from both sides. Both of them kept increasing their force, trying to push the sword towards the other. Finally, Aisha cried out &ldquo;Lord Ra, give me strength!&rdquo; and pushed towards the sword with a force so strong that it came ramming towards Amenhotep.</p>

<p>Amenhotep dodged quickly. The sword struck the wall behind him with such a force that it shattered into several shards with the main hilt being completely buried into the wall. Aisha thanked the Lord for his support, then came running towards Amenhotep to land her blow.<br />
 <br />
But Amenhotep pushed her away with his force. &ldquo;That was impressive, child, calling on help from others when you yourself can&rsquo;t do the job. But you aren&rsquo;t the only one who can do that. Let me show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he raised his hands and said, &ldquo;Horus, I call upon you! Become a part of me, and lend me your power!&rdquo; Aisha realized with horror what he was going to do. He was not just calling for strength, he was channeling Horus through him. Horus was the Egyptian god of strength, and any pharaoh could call upon him to become nearly invincible.<br />
 <br />
His body exploded, muscles rippling as the lean figure became bulky. His height increased by several inches, and he towered above Aisha, who stood frozen in place, unable to think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am God&rdquo;, said Amenhotep-Horus. &ldquo;There is no one above me in strength, power or speed. Yet you dare to blaspheme against me?&rdquo; he bellowed as he rammed into her, then used his magic to pull on to her as if there was an invisible rope between them. He pulled her in a circle around the palace, Aisha crashing into everything that came in the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No man can ever defeat me. You are but a woman&rdquo;, he taunted as he pulled her towards him. With fist raised, he gave a nasty blow to her which sent her flying back and crashing into the wall. &ldquo;And not only that, you are the descendant of Sekhemkhet the failure. It amuses me how the idea came to your mind that you could take on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aisha looked up, dazed from the sudden flurry of damage.<br />
There must be some way to defeat him.</p>

<p>Just then she noticed a small ring on his foot toe in the left leg. It bore the symbol of Horus, the sign of being pharaoh. That must be it, she thought. Now she had to somehow get that ring out of his toe. She noticed a few of the shards of the sword that had been broken before. Picking up a good enough one, she stood in her stance in front of Amenhotep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet you are regretting having broken it now, I was far more merciful with the sword than I am now&rdquo;, he said mockingly.&rdquo; &ldquo;We shall see about that&rdquo;, Aisha snapped back with determination. Then, propelled with the strength of Ra, she dashed towards him. She kept changing her direction, confusing him, yet coming closer to him. Growing increasingly frustrated, he tried to catch her. &ldquo;Come here, you cursed thing!&rdquo;, he shouted as he ran towards her.</p>

<p>But this was exactly what she was counting on. As he punched, she dodged underneath and swung her dagger-like shard, cutting off the toe which held the ring. He bellowed out in pain as he came to a halt.</p>

<p>With the ring gone, he lost his power and reverted back. Without the ring, he no longer was a pharaoh, and he didn&rsquo;t have any of his magic. &ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo;, he muttered as his foot bled profusely from the fresh wound. But Aisha didn&rsquo;t wait anymore. &ldquo;This is from the people of Egypt!&rdquo; she cried out as she thrust the shard right through Amenhotep&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>
Epilogue: The New Queen Pharaoh</p>

<p>With the evil Pharaoh now gone, the time had come to undo the wrong that was done generations back. But Aisha was doubtful. There had been no Queen Pharaoh in Egypt ever before, and she doubted if the Egyptian people would accept her as one now. Most of the time, female heirs would give the kingdom to their elder brother or husband and get delegated to the background.</p>

<p>Not that Aisha would have liked to do that if she even had the option. But she wanted to be a just and compassionate ruler. She even had the novel idea of introducing something called &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, a form of rule in which people&rsquo;s consent was of the greatest priority. She did not want to become the oppressive ruler that Amenhotep had been. Although the initial motivation to overthrow him had come from a feeling of vengeance, it had now expanded to something much more. She could not leave the people of Egypt, those who had, perhaps unwittingly, helped her to become what she was now.</p>

<p>And so the decision of who the new Pharaoh would be was left on the people. To her surprise, the people reciprocated her love for them. As the freer of the oppressive rule under Amenhotep (who was considered as a deity being a Pharaoh), Aisha had achieved the status of a ruler who had been granted Divineness by Ra Himself.</p>

<p>Thus, Egypt got its first Queen Pharaoh, Aisha who took the name of Sitre Meryamum meaning &ldquo;Daughter of Ra, Beloved of Amun&rdquo;. The Egyptian Gods were equally pleased with her for bringing back religiousness. Anubis not only blessed the land with prosperity, but He also redeemed her father, who was now allowed to go to the Field of Reeds and rest in peace. Thus rose the New Kingdom from the ashes of the Old.<br />
