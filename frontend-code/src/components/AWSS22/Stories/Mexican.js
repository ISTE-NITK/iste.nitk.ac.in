    <p>The world was devoid of everything but the inky darkness. The faintest of footsteps echoed around him. Voices, barely audible over the void, seemed to call out to him, but he was too far to hear them. He saw a flash of light to his right, and his world suddenly shifted.</p>

<p>Gabriel awoke with a start, almost rolling off the bed in the process. He looked at the ceiling, still blurry-eyed from sleep and slightly dazed. He propped himself up with one hand, rubbing his eyes with the other. He looked around, puzzled, but soon recognized his familiar surroundings. With a slight smile, he climbed down his bunk bed, almost missing the last step.</p>

<p>Gabriel frowned slightly. He wasn't usually clumsy anymore. It was one of the first things that had been drilled out of him as a fresh recruit. He shook his head and gathered his toiletries. As he walked to the washroom, he noticed that there wasn't anyone else in the room except... him. Well, it wasn't surprising, considering he had likely woken up late. He was not looking forward to the reprimand the general would give him. Not that he could protest, having woken up late, but still, he had an odd, nagging feeling in his mind that he just couldn't put his finger on.</p>

<p>He stopped, dead in his tracks, desperately trying to clear the fuzziness in his head to think. He couldn't have woken up late. One simply doesn't sleep in, in the military. His comradas would have roused him just to annoy him if not for protocol. He rummaged through his belongings, trying to find his calendar. He found himself grinning like a madman after he compared the date encircled in red with the clock. It was the first day of his leave! He got to go back home and meet up with his family.</p>

<p>He hurried up, quickly zooming through his routine. The water was far colder than what he was used to, but he was too excited to care. Not long after, he was ready, suitcase all packed up. As he left the barracks, he searched for his friends. He saw some of them milling about, but they hadn't noticed him, probably busy with their</p>

<p>errands. He finally found them in the mess hall, animatedly arguing over something- likely one of Pedro's conspiracy theories. God knew where he came up with them.</p>

<p>Miguel sat towards the edge, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else, and Ikal was laughing while Alejandro and Carlos heatedly debated over... whether the President was an alien imposter? &quot;&iexcl;No Manches!&quot; he thought in disbelief, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, &quot;Of all the theories that Pedro came up with, that's the one they're arguing about!?&quot;</p>

<p>He chuckled at their antics, looking at them fondly. His chuckle was light, almost swept away in the light chatter of the mess, but Ikal turned sharply to look at him. He quickly excused himself from the table and approached Gabriel. He had an expression on his face that Gabriel couldn't quite decipher but greeted him warmly nonetheless.</p>

<p>&quot;Gabriel, mano, it's good to see you,&quot; he said softly. Gabriel just rolled his eyes, &quot;Come on, hombre, you saw me yesterday!&quot;</p>

<p>His eyes narrowed slightly before widening again. After a moment of silence, he replied, &quot;Ah, so you were behind the 'emergency inspection' yesterday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shhh! Don't rat me out like that, wey, the general will have my hide!&quot; Gabriel whispered back.</p>

<p>Ikal snorted, &quot;Like they can hear you.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nevermind that,&quot; Gabriel said, turning slightly to show his backpack, &quot;I'm going back home today!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You got your leave, then?&quot; Ikal asked softly.</p>

<p>Gabriel nodded excitedly.</p>

<p>&quot;That's good, mano,&quot; Ikal said slowly, &quot;Spend some time with your family, yeah?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Gabriel replied. &quot;See you all when I'm back!&quot; he called out to his friends.</p>

<p>&quot;Se- Yeah,&quot; said Ikal, looking back for a moment. &quot;See you around, Gabriel,&quot; he turned back, waving him goodbye.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>
<p> The station wasn't too far out from the base. Gabriel didn't quite remember the exact number, but it was a few kilometres away. He bit back a curse as he checked the time on his watch. He started a light jog, slowly picking up the pace as he contemplated whether he'd make it on time. From what he remembered, the regional line left sharp at 6 AM. That gave him a little over half an hour. Worst case scenario, he'd have to take the express line. Even then, that gave him barely an hour to work with, and he wasn't sure if the express line had a spontaneous booking.</p>

<p>Gabriel put those thoughts at the back of his mind. For now, he had to focus on getting there first. If he was lucky, he might be able to hitch a ride. He looked back to see if anyone was coming the same way as him. No one was. Gabriel cursed at his decision to travel by foot. If anyone ever asked, he'd blame Alejandro's fitness</p>

<p>fanaticism and the military drills rubbing off of him, but he had really begun enjoying exercising. Oh, his sister would definitely get a kick out of that, the little imp. The thought put a smile on his face. He couldn't wait to see her- all of them again.</p>

<p>He glanced towards the hills, a soft arc of light peeking out slightly. It never ceased to surprise Gabriel how early they woke up as a part of their routine. He would've had breakfast by now, and the sun hadn't even risen yet! Still, he had to admit there was something about the peace of early mornings that relaxed his dishevelled mind. He wasn't quite used to the extreme temperatures of Chihuahua, having grown up with the sweltering heat and humidity of Los Mochis. The gentle cold winds blowing past him were rather soothing, though.</p>

<p>Gabriel was so lost in his thoughts that he hadn't even noticed the station in view till the honk of the train brought him back to reality. With no time to spare, he made a dash for it. A quick glance told him it was 5:58 AM. He dodged and weaved through the crowd of travellers as best as he could. Luckily, he didn't seem to have knocked anyone over. Just as another honk from the train signalled its departure, Gabriel managed to hop into the nearest open coach. He let out a sigh of relief as the train steadily sped up, leaving the station behind. He had made it in the nick of time.</p>

<p>The train journey was going to be a long one, so Gabriel thought he should probably find a seat. Except, there were none. The seats were packed with locals commuting for their daily work, with the occasional tourist or two. He wandered around from coach to coach, hoping to find just one seat, but he had no such luck.</p>

<p>While he was okay with standing, at least till some of the other passengers got off, he really didn't want to be a nuisance. He had already knocked down another passenger, who was quite surprised, to say the least. He stared at Gabriel strangely for a moment before walking on. Gabriel was about to call out to him to apologise when a lady</p>

<p>appeared right in front of him. She had her back to him, but Gabriel stood still, wondering if he had done something. &quot;Excuse me, se&ntilde;ora?&quot; he called out. She kept walking as though she hadn't heard him. That... was strange. He looked around, but none of the passengers had paid any attention to the commotion.</p>

<p>Gabriel shook his head, tapping it lightly. Well, he'd better get on with finding a seat at any rate. All the seats were occupied, so someone must have already taken that lady's seat. He hoped he'd find a seat soon. The train travelled across the Copper Canyon for a stretch of the journey, and he really wanted to see it clearly.</p>

<p>His perseverance paid off, and he eventually found a seat- a window seat even. The entire coach was almost empty except for another person, actually, which was strange, but Gabriel wasn't too bothered. He'd had a dull headache for a while now, and he decided a nap would be the best course of action. The stop at Creel was a ways away, so he had plenty of time before they reached the Copper Canyons.</p>

<p>And so, with his backpack on his lap and his head leaning against the window, Gabriel drifted to sleep.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>
<p> The world was devoid of everything but the inky darkness. Footsteps shuffled around him- with him. Familiar voices travelled through the void, speaking in hushed tones, though he could only discern a few words- Seeker... hostages... cartel... backup. A muffled voice cried out his name as he turned. There was a flash of light to his right, and his world suddenly shifted.</p>

<p>Gabriel awoke with a start, knocking away the hand on his shoulder in surprise. &quot;Se&ntilde;or, are you alright?&quot; a soft voice asked him. He turned slightly to see a young lady looking concernedly at him. She had a conductor's cap and uniform on and held a ticket machine in one of her hands. &quot;Se&ntilde;or?&quot; she repeated once again. &quot;I'm fine, I'm fine,&quot; he replied. &quot;Just a headache, &quot; he said, flashing her a small smile, &quot;that, and a weird dream.&quot; &quot;Ah,&quot; she nodded in understanding, &quot;so, where are you off to?&quot; &quot;Last stop. Los Mochis,&quot; he replied. &quot;Mhm,&quot; she punched a few buttons on the machine and handed him the ticket, &quot;here you go. Drop it off in that box in the corner before you leave. Buen viaje!&quot; He took the ticket and asked, &quot;How much?&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot; &quot;Like, how much do I need to pay? For the ticket?&quot; She chuckled, &quot;You don't have to pay here, silly.&quot; With that, she left for the coach ahead. Gabriel tilted his head, confused. While he was lost in his thoughts, the compartment went dark.</p>

<p>Fear gripped Gabriel at the core of his heart. It told him to run, escape, take cover. It paralyzed his legs, leaving him unable to stand. Suddenly, the compartment was filled with light, once again. They were out of the tunnel. The fear was gone as quickly as it had come, but Gabriel was still shaking slightly.</p>

<p>That was... strange. Gabriel was never afraid of the dark. Granted, he wasn't quite fond of it either, but it hadn't ever terrified him before. He couldn't fathom why it had frightened him so much. That kind of fear- no dread, there weren't a lot of things that filled someone with so much dread. He was so close to his answer. If only his head stopped throbbing so mu- &quot;Attention all passengers,&quot; the speaker announced. &quot;Gah!&quot; Gabriel groaned in frustration, his thoughts scattered by the sudden announcement.</p>

<p>&quot;Passengers, we have arrived at Creel. We will be making a stop for five minutes. We will also be passing along the Copper Canyon for the next segment of our journey.&quot;</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>
<p> Gabriel walked back to his seat with a handful of snacks that he had taken from the onboard dining room. Se&ntilde;orita Conductor had been kind enough to point him to it.</p>

<p>He sat down, dumping the snacks on a nearby seat. He took a pack of Takis chips and started happily snacking on them. Soon, they would enter the Sierra Madre mountain range, where the canyons are located. Gabriel looked out of the window and saw a tunnel coming up. He took a deep breath... and just closed his eyes. He didn't want to deal with his irrational fear of darkness with the Copper Canyon so close.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes after a minute, just to be safe. They were past the tunnel. Gabriel let out a small sigh. With that done, he took a box of nachos and propped himself comfortably against the seat, enjoying the vista.</p>

<p>The bushes and sparse vegetation sprung up soon after crossing the desert-like area. The vegetation became denser the closer they got to the mountains. On more than one occasion, Gabriel had gone to the door at the gangway between the compartments to get a better view.</p>

<p>As the train made its way through seemingly impossible terrains to cross, he couldn't help but marvel at the amount of effort put into completing this railway. It had taken nearly a century of careful planning and engineering marvels to make a route across large mountain ranges, steep valleys, and numerous rivers.</p>

<p>Gabriel watched in fascination as the train slowly climbed up the towering Sierra Madre Mountains, even crossing over itself to gain elevation. He could see the mountains and canyons for miles covered with the dense vegetation that gave the canyons their name.</p>

<p>Minutes turned to hours as Gabriel watched the scenery, the train occasionally stopping at stations before resuming the journey. The monotony was broken when the train stopped at the town of Divisadero for about 20 minutes to let passengers enjoy the tourist destination.</p>

<p>Gabriel spent the next twenty minutes enjoying the scenic views from the town and the exquisite craftsmanship of the local Raramuri community. There was a panoramic viewpoint that allowed a stunning view of the canyons.</p>

<p>The towering mountains crossed over, and the canyons ran along at the bottom. The trees covered in droplets from the light shower earlier now shimmered in the radiant sunlight. Gabriel could even make out a rainbow in the distance.</p>

<p>The stalls were filled with arts and crafts handmade by the Raramuri people. Traditional clothes and jewellery were among the plenty of things that were sold. A vendor had several baskets on display and wove them artistically in front of the tourists.</p>

<p>Gabriel tried to buy some souvenirs at the marketplace, but it was far too crowded. He did manage to buy some trinkets from a kindly old lady who was selling them in a secluded corner.</p>

<p>Gabriel dashed back to the train at the end of the twenty minutes and got on before it left. On the way back, he grabbed a plate of tacos from the dining compartment</p>

<p>and made his way back to his seat. After stashing the trinkets in his backpack, he dug into his taco as the train resumed its journey.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>
<p> Gabriel spent the next few hours looking at the scenery through the window while reflecting on his time in the military. He still remembered the day he set foot in the boot camp five years ago. He had been nervous and easily flustered but determined. The training had been harsh and would often leave him completely drained by sunset. That was where he had first met Ikal.</p>

<p>A particularly gruelling day of training had left Gabriel dead on his feet. He couldn't even muster the energy to drag himself back to the barracks. He had been fully prepared to be chewed out by the drill sergeant before someone had come to lend him a hand. The darker-skinned figure helped him to his feet and subtly supported him till they reached the barracks.</p>

<p>&quot;Muchas gracias,&quot; Gabriel had thanked him. &quot;De nada,&quot; he had replied, shaking his head. After a moment of silence, Gabriel had awkwardly introduced himself. &quot;It is nice to be meeting you, Gabriel. I am called Ikal,&quot; he had replied in kind.</p>

<p>And that had been the start of a great friendship. Gabriel hadn't always had training with Ikal, but he would always spend time with him afterwards. Gabriel would talk about his city and his hobbies which had fascinated Ikal. Ikal was ever-curious, soaking up everything he had learnt like a sponge.</p>

<p>Gabriel had learnt that Ikal hailed from an indigenous tribe well known for their seclusion. That had certainly explained Ikal's odd and outdated speech pattern. Ikal's</p>

<p>heritage had, in turn, fascinated Gabriel, who would listen to Ikal's tales with raptured interest.</p>

<p>While Ikal had narrated many fantastical tales enthusiastically, he hadn't been very forthcoming with his own past. Of course, Gabriel respected him enough to not pry, but he was curious nevertheless. Gabriel had happily answered Ikal's questions, however. When Ikal had asked him why he had joined the military, Gabriel immediately started his tirade about the drug cartels. How they brought strife and unease. How they disturbed the general peace. How they attracted unwanted attention.</p>

<p>He had gone on and on, for who knew how long, Ikal being too amused to interrupt him. He hadn't been the only one amused. The whole cafeteria had gone silent, listening to Gabriel's rant. The drill sergeant had eventually interrupted him with an amused smile on his face, &quot;I like the enthusiasm, novado, but try channelling that spirit during your training instead of dinnertime, yeah?&quot; The cafeteria had burst into laughter while Gabriel tucked his head in his arms out of embarrassment.</p>

<p>So, days passed into weeks and months, and soon they graduated from their training. Gabriel's family had come to bid him farewell before he was stationed. He dragged Ikal for a short while to introduce his friend to his family. He never mentioned it to Ikal, but he did feel sad that no one had come to meet Ikal.</p>

<p>After a tearful goodbye with his family, Gabriel had boarded the bus that took him to his base. He was first stationed in Jalisco for a year, where he learnt the ropes and adjusted to his new lifestyle. Ikal had been stationed at a different base to the north in Durango, but they had still kept in touch.</p>

<p>They met again sooner than Gabriel had expected when he was transferred for fieldwork in Chihuahua. The rising unrest due to the cartels had nearly reached a</p>

<p>boiling point, and manpower was wearing thin. Soldiers were often sent to the most conflicted areas as they were more strained on manpower.</p>

<p>That was where he had met Ikal again. They were assigned to the same unit and performed excellently in their missions. He had grown closer with his other teammates as well. Carlos was likeable and charismatic, quick to make friends. Alejandro was athletic and loved working out. He always encouraged everyone during physical training, pushing them further. Miguel was occasionally moody and obstinate but surprisingly passionate about firearms. Pedro was the life of the group, doing his best to persuade them about his conspiracy theories and pulling harmless pranks. Even Ikal had changed, no longer as awkward in his speech and behaviour as he had been.</p>

<p>A smile came over Gabriel's face at the thought of his friends. He wondered what they were doing now. Gabriel was lost so deep in his thoughts that he was startled by the speaker. &quot;Passengers, we have reached the last stop at Los Mochis. We hope you've had an enjoyable experience and hope you ride with us again,&quot; it announced.</p>

<p>Gabriel's eyes slightly widened in surprise. &quot;Huh. That was quicker than I expected,&quot; Gabriel thought. His smile widened nevertheless, and his body filled with excitement.</p>

<p>He was home.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>
<p> Gabriel stepped off the train and took a deep breath. The warm, humid air that filled the air would've made a visitor scrunch their face in repugnance, but it only made Gabriel smile. It greeted him like an old friend and welcomed him home. He was back home.</p>

<p>With a grin on his face, Gabriel set out towards the city. He really should catch a taxi and go straight home. He knew this, but he didn't want to. As much as he wanted to see his family, he hadn't been here for so long! He would still go straight home, he told himself, just on foot so he could take in the sights better.</p>

<p>Los Mochis had been his home for as long as he could remember, before he joined the military. He always loved exploring, and so he would sneak out of the house every Saturday to explore an unexplored part of the city. Oh, his mama had been absolutely furious when she had found out. She had grounded him for nearly a month. Then, he tried sneaking out the very next day. Luckily for him (and the rest of his family's eardrums), his primo Gerardo had already negotiated with his mama to take him around the city on the weekends he was free.</p>

<p>Ardo wasn't his hermano, but he'd been living with them ever since that dreadful day. Gabriel had really bonded with Ardo over the many weekly jaunts through the city.</p>

<p>He took a few moments to look at the massive stadium that they frequented in the past. Estadio Centenario was one of the biggest stadiums in Los Mochis and hosted various different sporting events. Unlike most folks in the city, Gabriel hadn't been a huge sports fan. Ardo, however, was. Whenever there had been a huge event at the stadium, Ardo would bring him along. He wasn't ever very invested in them, but Ardo would always find a way to make it entertaining for him.</p>

<p>Gabriel took a shortcut through the market complex, trying to identify the stalls. The market was closed at this time of the night, but Gabriel could still recognize the stalls. He had found this place on his second or third 'stroll', and he'd visited it every now and then. Gabriel found the tiny wooden stall where grumpy old t&iacute;o Sergio</p>

<p>crafted his barro negro pots. Further ahead, he found that colourful stall where se&ntilde;orita Manuela made beautiful souvenirs from seashells.</p>

<p>Quite a lot of the stalls were new, and there were a few that he couldn't find, but he did manage to find his favourite stall. It was a spacious stall where T&iacute;o y T&iacute;a Rosa made the best street food ever. They had everything from crispy taco dorados to sweet, melting camotes, but his favourite would always be the tamales. Stodgy, steamed corn dough wrapped in corn husks or banana leaves and stuffed with all sorts &ndash; from cheese to chicken, mole to pineapple. Something about them always left him wanting more.</p>

<p>Gabriel passed through the rest of the market, arriving at a street that led to the residential area. As he walked on, he noticed a trail of marigold petals along the road. He shook his head to clear a sudden bout of dizziness, and he continued along. It didn't take him long to find his house. The traditional Spanish villa that his bisabuelo Santiago had built decades ago still stood strong. It had a red-tiled roof, spotless white walls and numerous arched windowpanes. The interior had been renovated once to make it look more modern, but the exterior looked as good as the last time he had seen it.</p>

<p>Gabriel was giddy with excitement as he knocked on the door. He hadn't told them he was coming, of course, and he couldn't wait to see the surprise on their faces. When no one answered, he knocked again, slightly harder this time. Olivia usually answered the door pretty quickly, and so did Ardo. Maybe they had gone out? But the gate would be locked... in that case...</p>

<p>Gabriel turned back to see the gate was still closed. A dull ache in the back of his head grew as he stepped towards the gate. He bent down slightly to check it... it was locked... how had he gotten in? He clutched his head as a sudden spike of pain shot</p>

<p>through it. Something was wrong... had been wrong the whole day. He had to find his family.</p>

<p>As he lifted his head up, his eyes once again fell on the marigold petals. His mind wandered to some of the skull graffiti he had seen along the way. The date on his calendar rose to the front of his mind. As the pieces fell in place, Gabriel smacked his face. &quot;Of course,&quot; he breathed out, &quot;It's November 2nd, D&iacute;a de los Muertos!&quot;</p>

<p>He was probably excited about his leave that it had slipped his mind, but he still couldn't believe he had forgotten about it. It was an important day for him- for all of them. The Day of the Dead is more about life than death. It is a time to visit family graves and pray for those loved ones who have passed away.</p>

<p>Now he knew where to find his family.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>
<p> Gabriel tossed his backpack onto the porch and dashed out to the street. The petals were laid from the cemeteries to homes so that they could guide the souls of the departed ones. He followed the trail, letting it guide him, dashing past revellers in calavera masks and paint.</p>

<p>He soon found himself in front of the local cemetery. His head had started aching again and felt strangely heavy, but he couldn't let that bother him now. Gabriel made his way through the cemetery, searching for his family. It wasn't easy as there were plenty of people milling about, more than he had ever seen over there. He clenched his fists in frustration, biting back a silent scream. He</p>

<p>had searched almost the entire place but hadn't found them anywhere. There was just one last corner to check.</p>

<p>Gabriel made his way towards the crowd in that corner of the cemetery. He had avoided it as the atmosphere there was sombre, unlike the rest of the cemetery. He didn't know why his family would be in that crowd, but it was the only place he was yet to check. As he neared the gathering, a voice called out, &quot;Gabito?&quot; His eyes snapped in that direction, searching for the source of the voice.</p>

<p>Gabriel's eyes found a familiar old woman with a slightly hunched back. &quot;Abuela?&quot; he called out, unsure, &quot;abuela Silvia?&quot; &quot;Oh pobrecita, come here, nieto&quot; she hugged him, holding him close. &quot;I haven't seen you in forever! Is everything alright?&quot; &quot;Yes, yes, Gabito, I am fine. Everything will be alright. Now, come with me, nieto.&quot;</p>

<p>As she led him towards the crowd, a few people made their way to him. He called out to them in surprise, &quot;T&iacute;o Juan! T&iacute;a Maria! You're here!? But... how? It's been so long! Gerardo will be overjoyed!&quot;</p>

<p>They simply smiled at him, emotions flickering through their face. As he moved towards them, he felt something at his feet. He looked down and found a little girl hugging his leg. He gently picked her up and asked, &quot;Who's this little one, here?&quot;</p>

<p>She just pouted at him and started banging her tiny hands against his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Ow ow, okay, okay, not the head!&quot; Gabriel exclaimed, &quot;of course, I remember you, Bella. How can I forget my cute little prima? Now stop hitting my head!&quot;</p>

<p>Isabel gave him a look of mock indignation as she rolled her eyes, but she smiled regardless. &quot;There you go, little one,&quot; he said as he set her down. She looked at him and smacked his knee before running back to her parents.</p>

<p>Gabriel chuckled and looked towards his relatives. &quot;So, what are you all doing here? And where's everyone else?&quot; he asked them. His abuela was about to say something, but t&iacute;a Maria cut her off. &quot;It would be better to just show him,&quot; t&iacute;a Maria told her. Abuela Silvia looked slightly hesitant at first, but she nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Come with us, Gabito,&quot; abuela Silvia told him as they moved towards the gathering. Gabriel followed them, but his mind was filled with questions, and they hadn't answered yet. &quot;Show me what? Where are we going?&quot; he asked them, to no avail.</p>

<p>As they got closer to the crowd, some of them looked towards him, gasping. The others were still looking towards something at the centre. Some of them were wearing military uniforms, Gabriel noted with surprise. The ache in his head was back, but he paid it no mind. Gabriel recognized them, the figures in military uniforms. He took off towards them as his abuela exclaimed at him, &ldquo;Gabito!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The throbbing in his head went from bad to worse, but he couldn't care less. The day kept throwing questions at him, and he had to get some answers before his head exploded.</p>

<p>Just as reached the edge of the crowd, a figure stood in front of him, hands spread out. &quot;Whoa there, mano,&quot; he said to Gabriel, &quot;we can't have you knocking the crowds down.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabriel came to a halt as he looked at him. &quot;You? What? Here? How? Huh?&quot; Gabriel asked rapidly.</p>

<p>Ikal let out a snort, &quot;Good to see you too, mano.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabriel just stared at him, almost as though he would pluck the answers right out of Ikal's head.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll get your answers, Gabriel, but first, isn't there something else you had to do first?&quot; Ikal said, pointing somewhere towards the crowd, &quot;They are in there.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabriel looked in the direction Ikal pointed to and then back to him. &quot;I want some answers when I get back, hombre,&quot; Gabriel said with certainty.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Ikal said, nodding, &quot;Go on, then.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabriel walked past him and into the crowd. The crowd was large but somewhat organised, so he could pass through with no difficulty. All of them were fixated on the object at the centre. Gabriel was closer now, so he could make out what it was.</p>

<p>It was a wooden coffin, far more ornate than the ones they sell at the funerarias. &quot;It is a crowd of mourners,&quot; Gabriel realised with a jolt. A horrible sensation of dread pooled in the pit of his stomach, and his head throbbed violently. His eyes scanned his surroundings wildly, searching for his family. They widened with surprise when he found them at the centre, right next to the coffin. They were crying, no mourning, he realised.</p>

<p>Mam&aacute; was weeping loudly, her head pushed against pap&aacute;'s shoulder. Pap&aacute; himself looked devastated, eyes closed in anguish. Olivia was quieter than he'd ever seen her, sobbing quietly as abuelo Jos&eacute; patted her head. Ardo looked absolutely broken as he just stared at the coffin. Gabriel hadn't seen him this shaken up since the day t&iacute;o Juan and t&iacute;a Maria had died in that accident.</p>

<p>Clutching his head in one hand, Gabriel made his way towards the coffin. Each step made his headache worse, but he felt a pull from the coffin- he had to get to it. His vision dimmed the closer he got, and his senses slowly dulled. The questions, the thoughts in his head disappeared, blocked by the fuzziness.</p>

<p>He reached the coffin, writhing in pain, but he persevered. He had to look inside the coffin. He had to see who was inside. He moved his hands away from his head and peered into the coffin. A familiar face stared back- his face.</p>

<p>One moment he felt his head splitting open and the next, nothing. And then the darkness took him.</p>

<h3>-X-X-X-X-</h3>
<p> The world was devoid of the inky darkness that surrounded him. He was in a room with his comrades around him. The room was dimly lit, and several people were tied up by the wall. He helped his team untie and steady them. Ikal dialled into the squad frequency.</p>

<p>Ikal: &quot;Seeker White 6, Seeker Red 6, over.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeker White 6: &quot;Go ahead Seeker Red 6, over.&quot;</p>

<p>Ikal: &quot;We have found the hostages. I say again, we have found the hostages, over.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeker White 6: &quot;Good job Seeker Red. Secure the hostages and wait for backup. Do not engage the cartel. Higher numbers than anticipated. Backup is on the way, over.&quot;</p>

<p>Ikal: &quot;Wilco, over.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeker White 6: &quot;Roger, out.&quot;</p>

<p>Ikal turned back to the team, &quot;You heard the man. Set up defensive positions. We wait for backup, then evacuate.&quot;</p>

<p>They replied in affirmative and took their positions. The backup soon arrived, and they were clear to evacuate the hostages. Gabriel escorted one of the hostages, a young girl.</p>

<p>As they escorted them out, the hall suddenly went dark. They were immediately on high alert, looking out for signs of trouble. Gabriel heard a low chuckle from far off. He quickly turned, reaching for his gun, when the voice said, &quot;You were warned. The little lady there won't be leaving alive. Heh.&quot; There wasn't enough time to aim his rifle. Gabriel pushed the girl out of the way before there was a flash of light to his right, and then his world went black.</p>

<p>Gabriel awoke with a start, clutching the side of his neck. His eyes were wide, and he was gasping for breath. &quot;Huh?&quot; he said, touching his neck. It felt ...thin... and bony. He removed his hand from his neck and stretched his fingers. He saw five bony digits wriggling in unnatural patterns. &quot;Aaah!&quot; he shrieked. &quot;Aaah!&quot; more voices shrieked back. He looked up in surprise and was greeted by the sight of skeletal figures surrounding him.</p>

<p>&quot;Gabito?&quot; one of the figures asked. It was shorter than most of the skeletons and looked more feminine. That and it had his abuela's hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Abuela Silvia?&quot; he asked her, tilting his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, nieto!&quot; she said, hugging him.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this what they call a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu?&quot; he thought out loud.</p>

<p>He heard a little snicker from below, &quot;Yep.&quot; He pulled back from his abuela and bent down to the little skeleton.</p>

<p>&quot;Bella, no, prima Isabel,&quot; he said softly, &quot;It has been a while, hasn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You saw me just a while ago, silly,&quot; she said, poking his skull.</p>

<p>&quot;You know what I mean,&quot; he replied, ruffling her hair.</p>

<p>&quot;I do,&quot; she whispered, sounding much older than a five-year-old girl should.</p>

<p>&quot;Since you're here,&quot; he said, slowly getting up, &quot;where are... ah there.&quot; He approached the two figures standing not too far from Bella.</p>

<p>&quot;T&iacute;a Maria. T&iacute;o Juan,&quot; he greeted them, &quot;Gerardo misses you greatly.&quot; They look at each other before turning back.</p>

<p>&quot;We know, Gabriel,&quot; tio Juan replied, &quot;We miss our boy too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for looking after him,&quot; tia Maria told him, smiling at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, no, he was looking after me, if anything,&quot; Gabriel replied.</p>

<p>&quot;You helped him more than you know, mijo,&quot; tio Juan shook his head.</p>

<p>Gabriel just smiled, shaking his head. He examined his bony fingers and spoke softly to himself, &quot;I'm really dead, then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid you are, Gabriel,&quot; a familiar voice said.</p>

<p>Gabriel turned to face him, &quot;Ikal! You're not a skeleton! You're not dead then?&quot;</p>

<p>Ikal nodded, &quot;Very much alive, mano.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then how can you see me? You could see me in the morning too, right? Unless I dreamt that bit?&quot; Gabriel asked him</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, I did see you. You didn't dream that,&quot; Ikal replied, &quot;I can see the spirits of the dead. Have always been able to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh,&quot; Gabriel eloquently reacted.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry for not telling you. Both, about my powers and your death,&quot; Ikal said, lowering his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, hombre, it's alright. I'm sure you had a good reason, yeah?&quot; Gabriel assured him.</p>

<p>Ikal nodded. &quot;I could tell... that you didn't know. About your death, I mean. The realisation can be a shock. So I thought... you'd like to have your family nearby when you found out.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabriel's eyes widened in understanding. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;That wasn't all I was talking about, Gabriel,&quot; Ikal said, his voice shaky, &quot;Your death... I'm sorry...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did I die? When did I die?&quot; Gabriel asked him, &quot;I remember the mission.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was two days ago. They tripped the power supply. Came after the girl, the politician&rsquo;s daughter, and the situation escalated,&quot; Ikal answered.</p>

<p>&quot;The girl... she's safe?&quot; Gabriel asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. You pushed her out of the way in time. Took a bullet to your neck... By the time we got the situation under control, it was too late...&quot; Ikal said woefully, &quot;I should've been paying more attention. I'm sorry, Gabriel. I'm so sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It wasn't your fault, Ikal,&quot; Gabriel consoled him, &quot;I knew what I was getting into when I joined the army, you know. And I don't regret it, not one bit. Don't be too hard on yourself, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>Ikal nodded silently.</p>

<p>&quot;Take care of the rest of them, yeah? They must've taken it hard,&quot; Gabriel told him.</p>

<p>Gabriel recalled the breakfast that morning. Miguel&rsquo;s genuine frustration, disguised by his usual moody exterior. Pedro, staring vacantly while his conspiracy theory was being discussed. Carlos, the most sensible of them, and Alejandro who rarely ever spoke, heatedly debating said conspiracy theory. Ikal&rsquo;s own forced cheer that didn&rsquo;t quite reach his eyes. It was so much clearer without the fuzziness muddling his mind.</p>

<p>Ikal just nodded silently again.</p>

<p>Gabriel moved to hug Ikal, happily surprised that he could actually touch him. &quot;It's alright, Ikal, ese. Who knows, with all this afterlife stuff, we might get to meet again. Don't be too eager to follow me here and work yourself into an early grave, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll try,&quot; Ikal promised. He pointed at Gabriel and said, &quot;Looks like you have to go.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabriel looked at himself and saw himself slightly shimmering, &quot;Guess I do.&quot; He looked back up at Ikal and said, &quot;Adi&oacute;s, amigo. Tell my family that I love them. Tell them to take care.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabriel shimmered out of existence in a soft glow. He felt lighter than he had ever before. When he opened his eyes again, he saw his family looking towards him, smiles on their faces. &quot;Come, Gabito,&quot; abuela Silvia beckoned to him, &quot;Let us go home.&quot; A warm feeling bloomed inside him.</p>

<p>He smiled and said, &quot;Yes. After everything, I'm going back home.&quot;</p>
