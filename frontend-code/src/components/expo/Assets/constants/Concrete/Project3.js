                The open-story segment in a building has only columns and no partition walls; its presence causes a discontinuity in the rigidity of the structure. Furthermore, irregular floor plans cause torsional effects on the building. Both features greatly affect a structureâ€™s earthquake resistance. 
                By observing the results (story drift and torsion) obtained after dynamically analyzing different building models on ETABS, this project aims to demonstrate how irregular floor plans and the presence of an open story (on varying floor levels) affects the behavior of a building when subjected to earthquake loads.
