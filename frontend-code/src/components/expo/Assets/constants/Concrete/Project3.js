                Climate change is having a tremendous effect on our fragile ecosystem, where the acceleration of its impact is believed to have occurred due to human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is estimated that the building sector accounts for 40% of the worldâ€™s energy consumption. Passive design strategies are features innate to the form and design of a building that channelizes available natural resources to ensure thermal comfort and reduce the usage of lighting devices. In this project we analyzed the impact of various passive design strategies that improve the energy efficiency of buildings in India.
