                We used a DSLR, a beginner's camera that had a resolution of
                20-24 MP. The lens we used was the 18-55 mm short range lens.
                Although, it does the job very well we could've taken better
                shots of we had a higher aperture ( less than the f/3.5 we were
                able to use )<br />
                We could've also taken more clear shots if we could've travelled
                to a place with lower light pollution. This would've enabled us
                to use a slightly higher ISO and shutter speed to capture the
                details in high clarity.
